			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Category Management and Transaction Splitting",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Category management interface with CRUD operations, 2) Transaction splitting modal and UI, 3) Split validation and mathematical operations, 4) Parent-child transaction relationships and data model, 5) Unsplit functionality and data integrity management, 6) Category deletion protection and transaction reassignment",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to complex data relationships, mathematical validation requirements, referential integrity concerns, and multiple interconnected UI components. The transaction splitting feature requires careful handling of parent-child relationships and data consistency."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Auto-Categorisation Rules Engine",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Rules management interface and CRUD operations, 2) Rule priority system with drag-and-drop reordering, 3) Rule matching engine and application logic, 4) Rule testing and statistics features",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving rule engine logic, priority-based processing, drag-and-drop UI implementation, and integration with existing import system. Requires careful handling of rule conflicts and performance optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Monthly Budget View and Budget Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Monthly navigation and date handling, 2) Budget aggregation and calculation APIs, 3) Budget entry and inline editing interface, 4) Budget vs actual comparison and visualization, 5) Budget templates and carry-over functionality",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to complex aggregation logic, multiple calculation requirements, inline editing functionality, and integration with existing transaction data. Requires careful handling of date boundaries and budget calculations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Dashboard Analytics and Google Drive Sync",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Analytics API endpoints and data aggregation, 2) Dashboard layout and summary cards, 3) Chart implementation with Recharts, 4) Google Drive OAuth2 integration, 5) Sync functionality (upload/download), 6) Backup and conflict resolution, 7) Sync UI and status management",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity combining data visualization, external API integration, OAuth2 authentication, file synchronization, and conflict resolution. Multiple third-party integrations and complex data flow management required."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Database Abstraction Layer",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is well-defined and focused on creating a single abstraction layer. No further breakdown needed as it involves creating a unified interface with clear technical requirements.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving abstraction design, async/sync compatibility, and runtime environment detection. Well-defined scope with clear technical requirements, but requires careful interface design to support both database implementations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Google Drive Configuration Settings",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is well-scoped for settings UI implementation with clear validation requirements. No further breakdown needed as it focuses on a single configuration interface.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving OAuth2 integration, folder validation, secure token storage, and UI state management. Well-defined scope but requires integration with Google Drive API and proper error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Tauri Project Setup and Build Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This is a straightforward setup and configuration task with clear steps. No breakdown needed as it follows standard Tauri initialization procedures.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving project configuration, build pipeline setup, and tooling integration. Mostly following established patterns but requires proper configuration for the specific project needs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Database Migration to Tauri Plugin",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task builds directly on the abstraction layer (Task 11) and has clear implementation steps. No further breakdown needed as it focuses on plugin integration.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving plugin integration, async operation handling, and maintaining compatibility across environments. Depends heavily on the abstraction layer design from Task 11."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Secure Token Storage and File System Handling",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task involves security-critical implementations with clear technical requirements. The scope is well-defined for secure storage and file system operations.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to security requirements, cross-platform file system handling, encryption implementation, and path resolution logic. Critical for application security but well-defined scope."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Window Close Handling, Auto-Update, and Distribution",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task covers final application lifecycle features with clear implementation steps. No breakdown needed as it focuses on native window management and update mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving native window event handling, version management, auto-update logic, and distribution pipeline setup. Multiple components but each with clear implementation requirements."
