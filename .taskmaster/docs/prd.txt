# Overview

Puffin (Personal Unified Finance Framework & Investment Navigator) is a locally-hosted personal budgeting application for tracking expenses, categorising transactions, and monitoring spending against budgets. It solves the problem of expense tracking without relying on cloud-based services or subscription fees, while enabling multi-device access through Google Drive database synchronisation.

The application is designed for individuals or households who want full control over their financial data, prefer local-first software, and need to access their budget from multiple computers. Unlike YNAB or GoodBudget, Puffin keeps all data local with optional manual sync to a shared Google Drive location.

**Target User:** Privacy-conscious individuals comfortable with self-hosted applications who want detailed expense tracking with budget comparison capabilities.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- Full data ownership with local SQLite database
- No subscription fees or cloud lock-in
- Multi-device access via Google Drive sync
- Flexible categorisation with auto-categorisation rules
- Clear visibility of spending as percentage of income
- Standalone desktop application — no Node.js installation required

# Core Features

## 1. Transaction Import & Entry

**What it does:** Allows users to import transactions from CSV files or manually enter them.

**Why it's important:** The foundation of expense tracking — getting transaction data into the system efficiently and accurately.

**How it works:**
- Import simple or extended CSV files via file upload
- Preview imported data in a table format with dropdown column mappers (date, description, amount)
- Option to remove unwanted rows before import
- Duplicate detection flags matching transactions (same date, amount, description) with option to skip
- Manual transaction entry form for accounts without export functionality
- Fields: date, description, amount, optional notes
- All transactions treated as single pool regardless of source account

## 2. Transaction Categorisation

**What it does:** Enables users to assign categories to transactions, with support for auto-categorisation rules.

**Why it's important:** Categorisation transforms raw transaction data into meaningful spending insights.

**How it works:**
- Two-tier category system: upper categories (renameable, default: Expense, Saving, Bill, Debt, Income, Transfer) and user-defined sub-categories
- Uncategorised inbox showing all unassigned transactions sorted by date (newest first)
- Auto-categorisation rules using "contains exact text" matching with drag-to-reorder priority
- Rules applied silently on import; categories always editable
- Transaction splitting: divide one transaction into up to 3 parts by amount, creating separate linked transactions with reversible history
- Transfer category ignored in reporting calculations

## 3. Monthly Budget View

**What it does:** Displays a month's transactions organised by category with actual vs budget comparison.

**Why it's important:** The primary view for understanding monthly spending and staying within budget.

**How it works:**
- Upper categories as section headers, sub-categories listed beneath
- Two columns per sub-category: Actual (calculated) and Budget (user-entered)
- Actual highlighted red when exceeding budget
- Budget entry options: fresh entry, carry over from last month, or reference watermark showing last month/average of 3 or 6 months
- Sub-categories with no budget show 0
- All month's transactions listed below category summary, editable for re-categorisation
- Click-through from sub-category totals to filtered transaction list

## 4. Dashboard & Analytics

**What it does:** Provides overview of financial health with key metrics and visualisations.

**Why it's important:** Enables quick assessment of spending patterns and trends without navigating multiple views.

**How it works:**
- Default landing page on app open
- Percentage-of-income breakdown showing how income divides across sub-categories (actuals only)
- Line graph: monthly spending trends over time
- Pie chart: income allocation across sub-categories
- Line graphs: trends for each upper category
- Month-over-month and year-over-year tables with selectable periods (3, 6, or 12 months)
- Drill-down to monthly or yearly detail views

## 5. Auto-Categorisation Rules Management

**What it does:** Allows users to create, edit, and prioritise rules that automatically categorise matching transactions.

**Why it's important:** Reduces manual categorisation effort for recurring transactions.

**How it works:**
- Settings page listing all rules
- Each rule: match text (exact contains) → assigns sub-category
- Drag-to-reorder for priority (first match wins)
- Add, edit, delete rules
- Rules cannot auto-assign splits

## 6. Google Drive Sync

**What it does:** Synchronises the local database to a shared Google Drive location for multi-device access.

**Why it's important:** Enables access from multiple computers without complex server infrastructure.

**How it works:**
- Manual sync trigger (not automatic background sync)
- On app open: prompt to pull latest from Google Drive
- On app close: block closing until sync completed
- "Last synced" banner displayed at all times
- Local backup created before each sync
- Conflict resolution: last-write-wins
- Supports multiple users with their own Google accounts accessing the same shared folder location (not simultaneously)
- User pastes Google Drive folder URL; app validates access before saving
- Sync configuration is optional — app works fully offline until configured

## 7. Undo System

**What it does:** Allows reversal of recent actions including deletions.

**Why it's important:** Provides safety net for mistakes, especially for destructive actions.

**How it works:**
- Soft-delete for transactions (recoverable)
- Undo last action button (Ctrl+Z pattern)
- Split transactions reversible to original single transaction

## 8. Desktop Application

**What it does:** Packages the application as a standalone Windows executable.

**Why it's important:** Enables distribution without requiring users to install Node.js or run command-line tools.

**How it works:**
- Single portable .exe file — no installer required
- Double-click to launch; no dependencies for end users
- Auto-update notifications prompt user to download new versions
- All data stored in standard Windows user data location (%APPDATA%)

# User Experience

## User Persona

**Primary User:** Individual or household member managing personal/family finances. Technically comfortable (can run local web applications), values data privacy and ownership, accesses budget from home desktop and laptop. Wants clear visibility of where money goes without subscription fees.

## Key User Flows

5. Import first CSV file
6. Map columns and confirm import
7. Categorise transactions in inbox

### Regular Usage (Weekly/Fortnightly)
1. Open app → sync from Google Drive (if configured)
2. Import new transactions from bank CSV
3. Review duplicate warnings, skip as needed
4. Process uncategorised inbox
5. Set/adjust monthly budgets
6. Review dashboard for spending insights
7. Sync to Google Drive before closing (if configured)

### Month-End Review
1. Open monthly view for completed month
2. Review actual vs budget per category
3. Adjust next month's budgets based on actuals

- Delete rule with confirmation
- Drag-and-drop reordering for priority

### 4.3 Rule Application
- On transaction import: apply rules to uncategorised transactions
- Process in priority order, first match wins
- Rules applied silently (no confirmation needed)

## Phase 5: Monthly Budget View

**Scope:** Month view with category breakdown and budget comparison.

### 5.1 Monthly Data Aggregation
- API to aggregate transactions by sub-category for given month
- Calculate totals per sub-category and upper category
- Fetch budget amounts for month

### 5.2 Monthly View UI
- Month selector (previous/next navigation)

## Phase 6: Dashboard & Analytics

**Scope:** Overview dashboard with charts and trend analysis.

### 6.1 Analytics API
- Percentage of income calculation (per sub-category)
- Monthly spending totals over time
- Upper category trends over time
- Month-over-month data (3, 6, 12 month views)
- Year-over-year comparison

### 6.2 Dashboard Layout

- Last-write-wins conflict resolution
- Update SyncLog on each operation

### 7.3 Sync UI
- "Last synced" banner (always visible when sync configured)
- Manual sync buttons (push/pull)
- Sync status indicator (syncing, success, error)
- Banner hidden when sync not configured

### 7.4 Sync Prompts
- On app open: modal prompting to pull from Drive (only if sync configured)
- On app close: blocking modal requiring sync before close (only if sync configured)
- Cannot dismiss close modal without completing sync or explicitly skipping

### 7.5 Settings: Google Drive Configuration

**Folder Location Input**
- User pastes Google Drive folder URL (e.g., `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ`)
- App extracts folder ID from URL automatically
- Validation on save:
  - Authenticate with user's Google account (OAuth2 flow)
  - Attempt to list folder contents via Drive API
  - Attempt to create/delete a test file (`.puffin-validation-test`) to confirm write access
  - Display success message with folder name confirmation
  - On failure: clear error message ("Folder not found", "No access to this folder", "Read-only access — write permission required")
- Store folder ID (not full URL) in local config file

**Multi-User Shared Folder Setup**
- Each user authenticates with their own Google account
- Each user pastes the same shared folder URL
- Folder must be shared with both Google accounts (standard Drive sharing)
- App validates each user's access independently
- No awareness of other users — each instance treats it as single-user access to a shared location

**Offline-Only Mode**
- Google Drive configuration is optional
- App fully functional without sync configured
- Settings page shows "Not configured" state with setup prompt
- Sync-related UI (banner, prompts) hidden until configured
- User can configure sync at any time

**Configuration Storage**

- OAuth refresh token stored securely (OS keychain via Tauri, or encrypted local file in dev mode)
- Config location: `~/.puffin/config.json` (dev) or `%APPDATA%/Puffin/config.json` (packaged)

### 7.6 Disconnect and Reconfigure
- "Disconnect" button in settings to remove sync configuration
- Clears stored folder ID and OAuth tokens
- App reverts to offline-only mode
- User can reconfigure with different folder or account

## Phase 8: Polish & Undo System

**Scope:** Soft delete, undo functionality, and UI refinements.

### 8.1 Soft Delete
- Mark transactions as is_deleted instead of removing
- Filter deleted transactions from normal views
- Optional: "Deleted items" view in settings

### 8.2 Undo System
- Action history stack (in-memory, cleared on page refresh)
- Undo button (Ctrl+Z keyboard shortcut)
- Undoable actions: categorise, split, unsplit, delete, budget change
- Visual feedback on undo

### 8.3 UI Polish
- Loading states for all async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Empty states for inbox, transaction list
- Responsive design adjustments
- Keyboard navigation improvements

## Phase 9: Tauri Desktop Packaging

**Scope:** Package the Next.js application as a standalone Windows executable using Tauri, enabling single-file distribution without requiring Node.js installation.

### 9.1 Tauri Project Setup
- Add Tauri to existing project (`npm install @tauri-apps/cli @tauri-apps/api`)
- Configure `tauri.conf.json`:
  - App name: "Puffin"
  - Window title: "Puffin — Personal Budgeting"
  - Default window size: 1280x800, resizable
  - Single instance enforcement (prevent multiple windows accessing same database)
- Build target: Windows x64 portable executable (.exe)
- No installer required — single .exe file distribution

### 9.2 Build Pipeline Integration

**Development Workflow (Retained)**
- `npm run dev` — Standard Next.js development with hot reload (no Tauri)
- `npm run tauri dev` — Run inside Tauri shell with dev tools for testing native features
- `npm run tauri build` — Produce release .exe

**Build Process**
- Next.js builds to static output (`output: 'export'` in next.config.js)
- Tauri bundles static files with Rust-based webview
- Single .exe output, approximately 10-30MB
- No external dependencies required on target machine

### 9.3 Database Migration to Tauri Plugin
- Install `tauri-plugin-sql` for native SQLite access
- Update `lib/db.ts` abstraction layer to use Tauri plugin when running in packaged mode
- Implement runtime detection: check if running in Tauri context
- Maintain better-sqlite3 for development mode (faster iteration)
- Test all database operations in both modes

**Migration approach:**
```typescript
// lib/db.ts pseudocode
const isPackaged = !!window.__TAURI__;

export async function getTransactions() {
  if (isPackaged) {
    // Use tauri-plugin-sql
    const db = await Database.load('sqlite:puffin.db');
    return await db.select('SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE is_deleted = 0');
  } else {
    // Use better-sqlite3
    return db.prepare('SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE is_deleted = 0').all();
  }
}
```

### 9.4 Secure Token Storage
- Use `tauri-plugin-store` or Windows Credential Manager for OAuth refresh tokens
- Encrypt tokens at rest
- Fallback to encrypted local file for development mode

### 9.5 File System Locations
- Database: `%APPDATA%/Puffin/puffin.db`
- Backups: `%APPDATA%/Puffin/backups/`
- Config: `%APPDATA%/Puffin/config.json`
- Implement path resolution based on runtime environment

### 9.6 Window Close Handling
- Intercept window close event via Tauri API
- Trigger sync prompt before allowing close (existing Phase 7 requirement)
- Prevent close until sync completes or user explicitly skips
- Only show sync prompt if sync is configured

### 9.7 Auto-Update System

**Update Mechanism**
- Check for updates on app launch (GitHub Releases API)
- Compare local version against latest available
- If update available: non-blocking notification banner
  - "Version X.X available — [Download] [Dismiss]"
- Download button opens browser to release page (manual download)
- No silent/automatic installation

**Version Management**
- Version stored in `tauri.conf.json` and `package.json` (keep in sync)
- Display version in Settings page footer
- Release notes viewable from update notification (link to GitHub release)

### 9.8 Distribution

**Build Outputs**
- `Puffin-vX.X.X-windows-x64.exe` — Portable executable
- Optional: `Puffin-vX.X.X-windows-x64.zip` — Zipped for easier hosting

**Release Process**
- Build via GitHub Actions (optional automation for future)
- Upload to GitHub Releases
- Update download link on documentation/landing page (if applicable)

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- QIF file format support
- Custom date range views
- Export functionality
- Additional chart types
- Mobile-optimised views
- Transaction search
- Recurring transaction detection
- Goals/savings targets
- macOS and Linux builds
- Code signing certificate (removes Windows SmartScreen warnings)

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges

### SQLite Concurrent Access
**Risk:** SQLite has limitations with concurrent writes; if sync doesn't complete properly, database corruption possible.
**Mitigation:** 
- Single-user access model (blocking sync on close)
- Local backup before every sync operation
- Implement WAL mode for better reliability

### Google Drive API Complexity
**Risk:** OAuth2 flow and token refresh can be complex; API rate limits possible.
**Mitigation:**
- Use established library (googleapis npm package)
- Implement token refresh handling
- Manual-only sync reduces API call frequency

### CSV Parsing Edge Cases
**Risk:** Bank CSV formats vary widely; parsing failures frustrate users.
**Mitigation:**
- Preview table allows users to verify parsing before import
- Column mapping puts control in user hands
- Start with simple CSV; add format support iteratively

### Database Abstraction Layer
**Risk:** Abstraction adds complexity; potential for bugs when swapping implementations.
**Mitigation:**
- Design abstraction early (Phase 1) before building features on top
- Comprehensive tests for database operations
- Test both implementations (better-sqlite3 and tauri-plugin-sql) in CI

## Tauri-Specific Risks

### WebView2 Availability
**Risk:** Older Windows 10 installations may not have WebView2 runtime.
**Mitigation:** 
- Tauri auto-prompts installation if missing
- Document requirement in release notes
- WebView2 is pre-installed on Windows 11 and recent Windows 10 updates

### Bundle Size
**Risk:** Including unnecessary dependencies inflates bundle.
**Mitigation:** 
- Use Tauri-native plugins (tauri-plugin-sql) instead of Node.js sidecars
- Tree-shake unused code in production build
- Target 10-30MB bundle size

### First-Launch Security Warnings
**Risk:** Windows SmartScreen may flag unsigned .exe as potentially unsafe.
**Mitigation:** 
- Document expected warning for users in release notes
- Consider code signing certificate for future releases (optional, has cost)
- Building reputation through downloads reduces warnings over time

## MVP Scope Risks

### Feature Creep
**Risk:** Adding features delays usable product.
**Mitigation:**
- Strict phase separation; complete each phase before moving on
- Layer 2 provides minimal usable product
- Future enhancements explicitly deferred

### Over-Engineering Sync
**Risk:** Complex sync logic delays core budgeting features.
**Mitigation:**
- Sync is Phase 7; full budgeting works without it
- Last-write-wins is simplest conflict resolution
- Can use manual file copy as interim solution

## Resource Constraints

### Single Developer
**Risk:** Limited time and attention; burnout possible.
**Mitigation:**
- Atomic feature builds allow progress in small increments
- Each layer delivers value; can pause between layers
- Avoid premature optimisation

### Testing Coverage
**Risk:** Bugs in financial calculations erode trust.
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritise tests for calculation logic (totals, percentages)
- Manual testing checklist for each phase
- Soft delete provides recovery from errors

## Google Drive Folder URL Format

Users copy the folder URL from their browser:
```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ
                                        └──────── Folder ID ────────┘
```

The app extracts and stores only the folder ID. The folder must be shared with the user's Google account with edit permissions.
